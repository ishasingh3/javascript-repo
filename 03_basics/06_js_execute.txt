#javascript execution context

1. 
  A. Global execution context (this is referred by this, (stored in it))
     (in browser, this = window object)

      Js is single threaded
 B. Function execution context
 C. Eval execution context

 Phases: 
    first: "memory" creation phase (only location is allocated)
      val1, val2 = undefined
      addNum = definition 
      result 1,2 = undefined
    
    second: execution phase
      val1 = 10 (value is assigned)
      val2 = 5
      (nothing in addNum as its defined in MCP, no execution )
      (it will make its own execution box)
      addNum = new variable environment + execution thread
         new sandbox is created 
         now we will have another memory phase 
         "MCP"
           val1 = undefined
           val2 = undefined
           total = undefined
        "execution"
           num1 = 10
           num2 = 5
           total = 15 ("return total": it is also returned back in global execution context)
        *this whole sandbox is deleted after work is done
      now for result 1,2 we need addNum
      result 1 = 15
      for result2 we will a function to execute now we will make another sandbox (new variable environment + thread)
      "memory phase"
      "execution phase"
